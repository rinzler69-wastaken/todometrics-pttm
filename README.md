## üß† Philosophy

**todometrics** is designed for simplicity and discipline. The core principles are **immutable commitments** and **measurable progress**.

* **Deliberate Planning:** Core task details (Name, Due Date, Priority) are set in stone upon creation.
* **Flexible Method:** The commitment is firm, but the method can evolve. Only the 'Description' is editable.
* **Decisive Action:** Completing a task is an irreversible action that moves it to your permanent archive.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Overview Dashboard:** Get at-a-glance insights into your performance with statistics for ongoing and completed tasks.
* **Interactive Performance Graph:** Track your discipline over time with a simple scoring system (+2 for ahead of time, +1 for on time, -1 for overdue), visualized in a monthly or yearly graph.
* **Advanced Task Management:** Create, edit, complete, and delete tasks through a clean and responsive modal interface.
* **Completed Task Archive:** An immutable archive of all your accomplishments, with filtering by month/year and client-side search.
* **PDF Export:** Export your filtered completed tasks to a clean PDF report for your records.
* **Persistent Light/Dark Theme:** A sleek, modern UI that respects your system settings and can be toggled manually. The choice is stored locally to prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content).
* **Client-Side Search:** Instantly find ongoing or completed tasks with a type-to-search function.
* **Responsive Design:** A great user experience on both desktop and mobile, featuring a dedicated bottom navigation bar for smaller screens.

* **Backend:**
    * **Go:** The core programming language.
    * **Gin Gonic:** A high-performance HTTP web framework for routing.

    * **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6):** For all client-side interactivity, structured into reusable modules.
    * **Bootstrap 5:** For the responsive grid system and core components.
    * **Chart.js:** For rendering the interactive performance graph.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Go installed on your machine (version 1.18 or newer).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rinzler69-wastaken/todometrics-pttm.git](https://github.com/rinzler69-wastaken/todometrics-pttm.git)
    cd todometrics-pttm
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    The Go application lives in the `server` subdirectory.
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Go will automatically fetch the required modules from `go.mod`.
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
    The server will start, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This project is currently a **server-side rendered application**. The next major architectural step is to evolve it into a modern, decoupled web application.

* **Phase 1: API Refactor (In Progress)**
    * Convert all Go handlers to return pure JSON data, transforming the backend into a stateless JSON API.

* **Phase 2: SPA Frontend**
    * Develop a new Single-Page Application (SPA) frontend using **SvelteKit**.
    * This new client will live in the `/client` directory and will consume the Go API for a faster, more fluid user experience.
